# Pb_pollution_sourcing_MixSIAR
#RStudio MixSIAR coding and source data files from: "Quantification of Pb pollution sources in complex urban environments through a multi-source isotope mixing model based on Pb isotopes in lichens and road sediment," submitted to the journal "Environmental Pollution" for potential publication. Authors: Matthew Dietrich, Mark P.S. Krekeler, Masoomeh Kousehlar, Elisabeth Widom. Code was modified from Jack Longman, utilized previously in [Longman, J., Veres, D., Ersek, V., Phillips, D.
